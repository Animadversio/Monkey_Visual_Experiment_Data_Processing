going up at gen 5 ! Good 
Saturated?! All white in the field?
Gradually going up again at around gen 15! 
Meandering between 25-30 gen 
The increased firing rate is majorly on the initial response. 
However starting from 30 gen it's climbing up again. 
Seems more and more later time bin activity is recruited !! A dual peak activity???
30 gen it's 
35 gen it starts going up again. And the peak become wider, and much more sustained! 
Even at 40 it can still go up! 
Seems saturated around ~50. 
Really the response get much more sustained at later phase of the exp. (Stimuli driven? What changed?
Or just inner state?)

Seems the major contribution to evolution is the initial activity peak in the response.
The high noise caused the norm evolution not working totally! So in full evolution, the Optimizer stuck at low norm and still live in noise.
The low variability problem is big!
Or maybe the norm evolution is not well controlled.

30 [-0.6 1] 3 1 CMAES

30 is a Really Hashy unit
See what happens
Decrease the convergence rate, decay from 50 to 7.33 deg at 100 generations instead of 50 generations (Slower decay facilitate exploration ~ 40 gens. )
ZOHA_Sphere is doing really well! Outperform CMAES early on.
At about gen 25 the 2 evolution crossed and seems CMAES starts to get more spike esp. later sustained spikes. (probablu the norm is higher )
At gen 30 the exploration is around 28.5 deg and the mean response is higher than ZOHA
Sigma is 2.66, 2.33
Exploration mu is 28
Maybe we still decay too fast?
Or we really needs a high norm to get the neuron interested.
At generation 36,
Sigma = 2.36
Spherical Exploration range = 25.9 deg 
Spherical's step size is too small at this point, we are inferior
Should use inverse function decay instead of exponential decay?
Step 37
Sigma 2.35
Sphere degree 23.9
ZOHA_Sphere_lr seems to be worse at after evolving for a while,
Recorded the Matlab output! See we can reconstruct the sample diversity curve post hoc.
Random thoughts:
What's neuronal noise? How can that help or hinder evolution. Can we think about Hash as a weighted sum of a bunch of neurons with similar but different selectivity?

Exactly same as 003, but just change the decay rate of ZOHA_Sphere_lr to be linear instead of exponential, see slower decay will facilitate exploration at around 20-40 gens.
However, neither CMA nor ZOHA evolves ~ 18 gens, not that informative.
Actually the step size should be a function of evolving score! Not a function of generations. As many generations passed but score doesn't change much then you shouldn't tune your step size, you have to keep trying and moving.

Finally try a unit with more signal. (PSTH looks super healthy! Low baseline high response.)
(Eye signal lose again. Have to recalibrate from time to time. )
In gen 8, gen 9 the scores of 2 optimizers goes up together. Quite correlated~ Seems promissing
Add 100mL to finish this up.
Around gen 12 CMA starts to look better than ZOHA, not sure why. Have to look deeper into both.
Is that true that linear exploration is easier to memorize the evolved features than the Spherical one.
